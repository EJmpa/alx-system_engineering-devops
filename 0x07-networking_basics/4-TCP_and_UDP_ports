#!/usr/bin/env bash
# A Bash script that displays listening sockets with the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs

sudo netstat -tunlp

# This script uses the `netstat` command with the "-tunlp" flags to display listening sockets (-l),
# show both TCP (-t) and UDP (-u) sockets, display numeric addresses (-n), and show the PID and name of the
# program to which each socket belongs (-p). The `sudo` command is used to run netstat with root privileges,
# which is necessary to display the PID and name of the program.
